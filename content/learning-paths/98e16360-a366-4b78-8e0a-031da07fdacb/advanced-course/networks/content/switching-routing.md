**Explained**
**Layer 2 - Switching**

- Uses Mac Addresses (hardcoded into devices)
- Only for traffic in a local or private network
- Done by switches

Example Mac address: **f8:4d:89:84:eb:8e**

**Layer 3 - Routing**

- Uses IP Addresses
- For traffic and routing in a global matter
- Done by routers

Example IP address: **10.55.22.1/32**

### **Local Network**

- Switches donâ€™t care for IP-Addresses - only Mac-Addresses Layer 2 !!!
- Each computer can talk to the other on the same local network
- And it must be on the same subnet

### **IP Addresses**
**A subnet for one IP address**

**A subnet for two IP addresses**

**More subnets**

**A subnet for 256 IP addresses**

### **Routing Subnets**
- Talk to different subnets --> router (gateway) must be used
- Gateway IP needs to be specified --> Gateway IP must be usually on same subnet
