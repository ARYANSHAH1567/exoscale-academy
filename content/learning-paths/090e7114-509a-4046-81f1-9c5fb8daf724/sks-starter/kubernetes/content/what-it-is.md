Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.

**Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services that facilitates both automation and declarative configuration.**
