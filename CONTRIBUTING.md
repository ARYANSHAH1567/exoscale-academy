## <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m ‚Äúmy commit message w/signoff‚Äù
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:
